An example of the ***CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern*** is a system with a primary database that serves as the **system of record**, and a read database that functions as a **derived data store**. The read database maintains **materialized views** of complex queries derived from the primary database and is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency read operations.
All write operations (commands) are directed to the primary database, while read operations (queries) are served from the read database. To keep the two data stores synchronized, **event streaming** mechanisms—using tools such as Apache Kafka—are employed to propagate changes from the primary database to the read database. This enables the read side to remain eventually consistent with the authoritative source of truth on the write side.
However, several challenges arise in practice. Similar to the replication lag problem in traditional database replicas, the derived data system can experience event processing lag, leading to inconsistencies. One potential issue is the time-travel problem, where out-of-order event delivery (for example, due to lag or reordering across Kafka partitions) causes an older event to overwrite the effects of a newer event. To mitigate this, it’s often desirable to partition the event log and the derived state using the same partitioning key, ensuring **monotonic reads** and improved consistency guarantees.
Despite these measures, data drift between the primary and derived systems can still occur. When the derived data becomes inconsistent, several remediation strategies are available:

- Rebuild from the source of truth by reapplying all events from the beginning (“big bang replay”).
- Partial replay, where a snapshot of the derived state is taken at a known good point in time, and only subsequent events are reapplied.
- Direct reconciliation, where the derived data system is repaired using authoritative data from the primary database.

Each approach involves trade-offs between recovery time, system availability, and operational cost. The right strategy depends on system size, event ordering guarantees, and the tolerance for temporary inconsistency.
