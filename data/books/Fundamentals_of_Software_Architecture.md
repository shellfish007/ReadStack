Chapter 1-9 has topics on
Modularity (cohesion, coupling and connascence)
- Architecture Characteristics (e.g. availability, scalability)
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Chapter 9-18 shows how quality attributes are embodied in different software architectures, where you can find topics on 
- Monolithic Layered architecture (presentation layer, business layer, database layer) 
- Monolithic Pipeline architecture (e.g. terminal pipelines)
- Monolithic Microkernel architecture (e.g. Jenkins with plugins)
- Distributed Service-based architecture (e.g. E-Commerce Application having different backends for different services like Order, Paymentâ€¦)
- Distributed Event-driven architecture
- Distributed Space-based architecture
- Distributed Microservices architecture
I think only several of them are being widely used though.
