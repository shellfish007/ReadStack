This helps go deleveoper to learn about how quality attributes are embodied in Go, where you can find topics on:
- Stability(circuit breaker, debounce, retry, throttle, timeout)
- Dependability(fault prevention, fault tolerance, fault removal, fault forecasting)
- Coupling(Request-Response Messaging vs Publish-Subscribe Messaging)
- Resilience(load shedding, backoff, signals and traps)
- Observability(distributed tracing, metrics, logging)
- Security(authentication, authorization, confidentiality)
