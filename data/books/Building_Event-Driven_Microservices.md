The book help those who already know about the pros and cons of asynchronous events vs synchronous request response and want to learn more about event-driven architecture specifically. It focus on:
- Difference between event broker and message broker (e.g. Apache Kafka vs RabbitMQ)
- Data Contracts and Schema Evolution (e.g. schema of kafka events)
- Identifying and publishing cross-domain data sets to event streams (sending messages to kafka brokers)
- Data processing techniques: event repartitioning and transformations such as filter
- Stream processing: timestamps, event scheduling, watermarks 
- Frameworks: Apache Spark, Flink, Storm, Heron, Beam, Apache kafka
- Tooling, testing and deployment
